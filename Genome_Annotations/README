# This pipeline uses derfinder to scan the genome for expressed regions and checks overlaps with known features, if any. 
# It requires data from various databases in BED/GTF and FASTA format. 
# tRNAs are gathered from gtRNAdb
# piRNAs from piRNAdb v1.7.6
# miRs from miRbase version Dec 2022
# sno from snoDB (USherbrooke) - these had nonunique sequences even with unique IDs. Version from Feb 2023.
